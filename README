git-hooks - A tool for managing and invoking custom git hook scripts.

Description:
    git-hooks is a tool to facilitate git hook management, specifically being
    able to store your hooks under source control within the repository itself
    and simply reference them from a multiplexer hook installed in the
    .git/hooks directory.

    The expected usage is to write an arbitrary number of individual hook
    scripts associated with a single standard git hook and store them in the
    .githooks directory. When git invokes the multiplexer script in .git/hooks,
    it will call your custom scripts sequentially, or in parallel if you
    configure it to do so.

    This way you can break your monolithic hooks into individual files, giving
    you greater flexibility regarding which pieces to run and when.

Installation:

    # Install GNU getopt (if not already present for your platform).
    getopt -T
    if [[ $? -ne 4 ]]; then
        brew install gnu-getopt
        # -- or --
        sudo port install getopt
    fi

    # (Optional) Install 'git hooks' as a global alias.
    # This allows you to do 'git hooks install' in new repositories rather than
    # locating the command via its path.
    # Regardless, a local alias will be created in your repository's git config
    # in the next step.
    path/to/git-hooks/git-hooks install-command --global

    # Install the multiplexers and the 'git hooks' alias in a repository.
    cd <to your repo>
    git hooks install
    # -- or ---
    path/to/git-hooks/git-hooks install  # If you skipped the global alias step

    # Configure git to automatically install the multiplexers for all new
    # repos (cloned or init'ed). This will make it so that you never have to
    # run 'git hooks install' again for this machine.
    # Useful when your repositories already have a .githooks directory with hook
    # scripts in it or if you plan to make regular use of the 'git hooks'
    # functionality.
    git hooks install-template

Files:
    .githooks/
        This is where git-hooks will look for default hook scripts. Place your
        hook scripts in here rather than .git/hooks. Your hook scripts should
        be executable and follow the naming convention:

            <standard git hook name>-<custom suffix>[.<file extension>]

        They will be executed in alphabetical order, so if you wish to control
        the order of execution, take that into account when naming the files.

        Examples: .githooks/pre-commit-00-style.sh
                  .githooks/pre-commit-01-unittest.py

    .git/config
        git-hooks config settings will be stored in your repository's config
        file. In the case of a bare repository, the config file is located at
        ./config.

    ~/.gitconfig
        If you opt to install the 'git hooks' alias as a global alias, it will
        be added to this file.

    ~/.gittemplate/hooks
    ~/.gittemplate/config
        These files will be updated if you choose to install the hooks into your
        repository template by running 'git hooks install-template'.

Common Arguments:
    <path>...
        The command accepts a list of path strings.

    <git hook>...
        The command accepts a list of git hook names. These names should only
        include the names of the standard git hooks:

            applypatch-msg
            pre-applypatch
            post-applypatch
            pre-commit
            prepare-commit-msg
            commit-msg
            post-commit
            pre-rebase
            post-checkout
            post-merge
            pre-push
            pre-receive
            update
            post-receive
            post-update
            push-to-checkout
            pre-auto-gc
            post-rewrite

    <custom script name>...
        The command accepts a list of hook script names. These names may
        indicate scripts in the repo's .githooks directory, or external
        scripts installed via 'git-hooks add'. Standard git hook names are
        not considered valid items in this list.

Operations:

    list [<git hook>...]
        Lists the currently available custom scripts for each standard git
        hook. If any are disabled, it is noted in the output.

    enable [-q|--quiet] <git hook>... <custom script name>...
        Enables a script (or scripts) to be run during git hook
        invocation. Scripts are enabled by default.
    
        If --quiet is specified, the updated enabled state of all hook
        scripts will not be displayed.

    disable [-q|--quiet] <git hook>... <custom script name>...
        Prevents a script from being run during git hook invocation.
    
        If --quiet is specified, the updated enabled state of all hook
        scripts will not be displayed.

    run [-f|--force] <git hook>|<custom script name>
        Runs a git hook or an individual custom script. stdin and any
        extra arguments will be forwarded to the designated target.
    
        This command respects the enabled/disabled state of the hooks and
        scripts. You can force the hook or script to run by specifying the
        --force flag.

    install [-e|--examples] [--no-preserve]
        Installs the multiplexer hooks into the .git/hooks directory.
        These scripts are the core of the git-hooks functionality.
        They are responsible for running any configured custom scripts
        according to your specifications (sequential vs parallel,
        disabled, etc.). This operation alse creates the .githooks
        directory and moves any existing hooks into it. Any scripts
        moved in this process will receive the "-moved" suffix.
    
        If --examples is specified, an active example script will be
        created in the new .githooks directory.
    
        If --no-preserve is specified, no existing hook scripts in
        .git/hooks will be moved to the .githooks directory with the
        "-moved" suffix.

    uninstall 
        Removes the multiplexer hooks from the .git/hooks directory and
        removes the 'hooks' alias from the repo's config, if present.

    install-command [--global] [--core]
        Installs 'git-hooks' command into any of three locations.
            --global: Add it to the global git aliases
            --core: Links this file into this machine's git core
                    directory. Any 'hooks' aliases will no longer be
                    effective.
    
        If neither --global nor --core are specified, the alias will be
        installed into the repo's local git config.

    uninstall-command [--global] [--core]
        Clears the 'git-hooks' command from the specified location.
            --global: Remove it from the global aliases
            --core: Delete the git-hooks link from this machine's git
                    core directory.
    
        If neither --global nor --core are specified, the alias will be
        removed from the repo's local git config.

    install-template 
        Installs the multiplexer scripts into ~/.gittemplate/hooks (or
        into the location defined by the init.templatedir config value).
        This will cause any subsequently cloned or created repositories to
        automatically populate their .git/hooks directories with the
        multiplexer script and provide them with the 'git hooks' alias.
        To update previously cloned repositories, just run 'git init' again.

    uninstall-template 
        Undoes the effects of 'install-template'.

    include [<custom script name>...]
        Copies a script included with the git-hooks command to your
        repository's .githooks directory.
    
        If run with no arguments, a list of available scripts and their
        purposes will be displayed.

    add <path>...
        Adds new scripts to be run when their associated git hooks are
        invoked. <path>... should be a list of paths to external custom
        scripts. Any paths indicating scripts residing in the .githooks
        directory will be ignored.

    rm <custom script name>...
        Removes previously added scripts from being run during git hook
        invocation.

    check-support 
        Checks for differences in the list of hooks supported by
        git-hooks and the list of hooks supported by git. If differences
        are present, consider upgrading git-hooks or git.

    parallel <git hook> [<num>|-]
        Modify the hooks.<git hook>.parallel config setting. <num> should
        be the desired number of jobs to spawn when running the hook
        scripts. If <num> is not provided, it will display the current
        setting. If <num> is 0, it will be interpreted as the number of
        CPUs as seen by cpuid. If <num> is "-", the current setting will
        be cleared and the hook will not be run in parallel mode.
    
        When running in parallel, each script's output is buffered until
        it finishes. When complete, the output will be written to stdout.

    show-input <git hook> [true|false]
        Modify the hooks.<git hook>.showinput config setting. If no value
        is provided, it will display the current setting. If this setting
        is true, the received arguments and stdin will be displayed during
        git hook invocation.

    config 

    help 
        Displays this help message.

Writing custom git hook scripts:

    Once git-hooks install has been called for your repository, creating and
    installing your own hooks is a simple matter of placing them in the newly-
    created .githooks directory. Your hooks must follow a particular naming
    convention:

        <standard git hook name>-<custom suffix>

    When a git hook is invoked it will look for your hooks scripts with the
    corresponding prefix and call them according to your config. By default
    your scripts will be run sequentially in alphabetical order as they appear
    in the .githooks directory.

    You may also add external scripts using the git-hooks add command. These
    scripts need to follow the same naming convention as above, but cannot
    reside in the .githooks directory. These scripts will run after the ones
    found in .githooks and will be run sequentially in the order they appear
    in the .git/config file.

    Setting the parallel option (see above) will cause all scripts to be run
    concurrently without regard to their conventional order.

    Preventing parallel execution:

        If your script cannot be run in parallel with another of the same
        git hook family, you may enforce this by calling the exported function
        prevent-parallel from within your script.

        Example:

        #!/usr/bin/env bash
        prevent-parallel   # Will exit the hook with a non-zero exit code
                           # unless it is being run sequentially.
